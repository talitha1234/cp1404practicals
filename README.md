# Talitha's CP1404 Practicals

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## Lessons I've learned about clean code:

- Naming conventions help make code easier to understand and maintain
- Single Responsibility Principal (SRP) means a function should do one general thing
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY) means:
    - a function can be used for repeat code
    - to NOT test code using input from a user and it's better to write another line and comment out input line
