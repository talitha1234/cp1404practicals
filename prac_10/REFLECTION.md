## Q1. regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
    
I improved a little bit with my estimates generally speaking because I would often overestimate to start with.
If I get on something unexpectedly I tend to underestimate though by a large amount, but with small tasks I am generally
quite good at estimating now.

## Q2. regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

From giving peer reviews I've learned that I often miss 1 or 2 requirements in given tasks when I initially complete it.
A couple of good reviews I've done where I aimed to ask questions politely and offer insight if I felt I had any:
- [Prac 6](https://github.com/Jimmyrynn/cp1404practicals/pull/4)
- [Prac 5](https://github.com/callumjriley3/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

From being reviewed I've noticed that I will sometimes do something that has not been specified, such as
error checking.

## Q3. regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Maybe make functionality requirements that we are required to include for a program a different colour and include 
a key that specifies this, or just include a list of requirements without additional information to read through again.
